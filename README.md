# Readme

A fork of GetHerbert which removes and utilises more updated components from Laravel Framework. Used within Adtrak predominantly to provide a rapid boilerplate for WordPress plugins.

Framework is pulled via composer into the boilerplate and contains elements that shouldn't directly be edited within a plugin.
